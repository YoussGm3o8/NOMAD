# Contributing to NOMAD

NOMAD is migrating from a Python edge service to a small C++20 vehicle core.
Keep changes aligned with that direction: simple code, narrow ownership, explicit
behavior, and tests that do not need a drone.

## Start here

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a focused branch in your fork.
3. Install Pixi and run the relevant checks.
4. Read [the architecture](docs/architecture.md) and [the migration plan](docs/migration.md)
   before changing ownership boundaries.

```bash
pixi run lint
pixi run test-fast
pixi run docs-build
```

During the transition, use the current Python/SITL commands documented in
[development](docs/development.md). The C++ workflow is `build-core`, `test-core`,
and `sitl`.

## Target layout

```text
include/nomad/       C++ public headers
src/                 C++ implementation and thin CLI
tests/               CTest, unit, and integration tests
ros2/                ROS 2 adapter packages
python/              CV, ML, simulation, analysis, and utilities
mission_planner/     Ground-station client
```

The `edge_core/` tree has been removed. Do not recreate dynamic modules,
service registries, REST layers, or Python vehicle-control paths. Put new product
behavior in the migration plan first.

## Code standard

Write for a first-year engineering student.

- Keep functions to about 40 logical lines or fewer.
- Treat 500 source lines as a refactoring signal.
- Use early returns and shallow indentation.
- Write explicit multi-line conditionals and loops.
- Give every function one responsibility and a precise verb name.
- Keep imports at the top and order them consistently.
- Keep comments to one line unless a longer explanation is genuinely necessary.
- Make top-level functions read as named steps.
- Prefer the standard library and existing project code.
- Do not add speculative abstractions, factories, registries, or fallback chains.
- Keep UI, ROS, transport, and core decisions separate.
- Never commit real hosts, secrets, emails, or absolute paths.

C++ code uses C++20, CMake, RAII, explicit ownership, small headers, and ordinary
standard-library types. MAVLink packet details stay inside the MAVLink boundary.
ROS 2 dependencies stay outside the core.

## Safety changes

Read [the safety case](docs/safety.md) before changing a command or actuation path.
Every safety change needs:

- a stable requirement ID;
- a test for normal, boundary, invalid, and failure inputs;
- acknowledgement or state-change verification for critical commands;
- SITL evidence when the flight behavior is affected;
- an updated requirement-to-code-to-test mapping.

NOMAD must never weaken or disable ArduPilot failsafes.

## Tests and checks

Run the smallest relevant check during development, then the full checks before
review:

```bash
pixi run build-core
pixi run test-core
pixi run test-python
pixi run lint
pixi run format-check
pixi run docs-build
```

The current Python test suite remains a transition gate. C++ tests use CTest and
fake transports. ROS 2 integration tests run in the dedicated container. Plugin
checks remain Windows-only where Mission Planner assemblies are required.

## Size policy

| Item | Rule |
|---|---|
| Function | About 40 logical lines; split by responsibility |
| Source file | 500 lines is a refactoring signal |
| Python line | 120 characters, enforced by Ruff |
| Generated/third-party files | Excluded from source-size checks |

Existing oversized files are tracked as migration debt. New or modified files
above 500 lines fail the changed-file check unless a temporary, reviewed exception
names an owner and removal issue.

## Review checklist

- [ ] The change belongs in this layer.
- [ ] Unused code was deleted before abstractions were added.
- [ ] Functions are small, explicit, and named by behavior.
- [ ] Core logic is testable without ROS, UI, or hardware.
- [ ] Inputs, errors, timeouts, and shutdown are handled.
- [ ] Documentation reflects current ownership and status.
- [ ] No new hardcoded host, secret, or absolute path exists.
- [ ] Relevant checks pass.

## Branches and commits

Use a focused branch in your fork. Keep one logical change per merge request and
use a subject no longer than 72 characters:

```text
[part,sub-part] Imperative description
```

Do not commit, push, deploy, or modify production infrastructure without an
explicit request.
