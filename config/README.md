# Configuration

nomad.env.example and profiles are deployment templates. Real values belong in
ignored local configuration; never commit credentials, actual endpoints or
machine-specific paths. Only onboard_companion, groundstation_gpu and
groundstation_minimal are supported product profiles. Older profile files are
migration artifacts and are not accepted by the profile manager.

Reviewed limits and validated settings feed core policy explicitly. Compute
placement does not silently choose navigation safety or command authority.
See [operations](../docs/operations.md) and [migration](../docs/migration.md).
