# Changelog

All notable changes to NOMAD are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- [core,mavlink] The hand-written MAVLink codec is **deleted** at the Phase E
  cutover: `src/mavlink/{protocol,udp_connection,udp_commands,fence,params}.cpp`
  and their headers, the build-time generated dialect headers, the CMake mavgen
  rule and its generator (`scripts/dev/generate_mavlink.py`, `pixi run
  generate-mavlink`), and the legacy transport test targets
  (`codec_golden_test.cpp`, `udp_connection_test.cpp`, `zero_delivery_test.cpp`)
  — their behavior is covered by the MAVSDK peer fixture and
  `nomad_mavsdk_zero_delivery_tests`. The pinned `third_party/ardupilot-mavlink`
  submodule stays only as the dialect the command-id gate resolves ids against.
  (2026-09-12, with explicit user authorization)
- [core,ros] The Python ROS-HTTP bridge (`edge_core/ros_http_bridge/`) is
  **deleted** — the C++ `nomad_vehicle_node` adapter (`ros2/nomad_ros`)
  replaces it end-to-end: it owns the MAVLink UDP link, the core velocity
  path (`/nomad/cmd_vel` + VIO health/confidence), and publishes `/nomad/*`
  telemetry. The compose `ros`/`gazebo`/`ros-gpu` profiles now run the node
  (fed by SITL / MAVProxy / a real vehicle on :14552); `Dockerfile.jetson`
  and `Dockerfile.sim-isaac` colcon-build `nomad_core` + `nomad_ros`; the
  systemd unit is `nomad-ros-vehicle.service` with
  `scripts/services/nomad_ros_vehicle.sh`; `scripts/nomad` service renamed
  `ros_http_bridge` → `ros_vehicle`; Isaac API routes manage the node
  (status key `vehicle_running`). The bridge's host unit tests
  (`test_bridge_http_client`, `test_coordinate_math`, `test_mavlink_velocity`,
  `test_mesh_packer`, `test_vio_math`) and its route pinning in
  `test_client_contract.py` were deleted with it. (Deletion gate 1, 2026-09-05)

### Added
- [core,mavsdk] Historical Phase B entry (2026-09-11; superseded by the Phase E
  cutover): opt-in MAVSDK-backed `MavlinkConnection`
  (`src/mavlink/mavsdk_mavlink_connection.cpp`, built only with
  `NOMAD_ENABLE_MAVSDK=ON`): commands go out as raw COMMAND_LONG/COMMAND_INT to
  preserve NOMAD's result-code and relative-altitude-frame contracts, telemetry
  is mapped into `VehicleState` with the same per-field validity flags and
  steady-clock timestamps. At that historical revision the CLI gained
  `--transport udp|mavsdk` (default `udp`) and `--system-id`.
- [test] Historical Phase B validation: `pixi run test-mavsdk-phase-b` built the
  opt-in CLI and
  `nomad_mavsdk_connection_tests`, then runs
  `scripts/dev/mavsdk_connection_fixture.py` against a deterministic peer
  (accepted, denied, timeout, no-peer, stale-telemetry, COMMAND_INT frame,
  wrong-identity, and per-command mode/takeoff/goto/land/RTL/servo/relay/
  gimbal-config/user-command cases where the peer applies the requested state
  change so the core's verification is exercised). Live Copter SITL evidence:
  with the historical `NOMAD_TRANSPORT=mavsdk` selector the `core-sitl-command-flow` and
  `core-sitl-payload` scenarios pass against Copter 4.7.1 (GUIDED mode, 3D GPS
  fix, arm, takeoff, guided goto sent as COMMAND_INT, RTL, land, disarm, all
  state-verified). Motor-test parity was added once C23 was fixed, so the
  command matrix is complete; Phase B remains open on vehicle-class
  identification and QuadPlane coverage.
- [cli] New `nomad velocity` verb: streams velocity setpoints through the C++
  core (armed + GUIDED + fresh VIO gates) for a duration, then reports the
  watchdog stop (`velocity_active`, `watchdog_reason`).
- [test] `tests/sitl/velocity_loop_closure.py` now drives the C++ CLI velocity
  verb against SITL (motion, watchdog stop, mode-gate refusal) instead of the
  retired Python controller — the loop-closure evidence is fully C++-owned.

### Changed
- [core,mavsdk] At the 2026-09-12 Phase E cutover, MAVSDK became the transport,
  not an option: `CMakeLists.txt` drops
  `NOMAD_ENABLE_MAVSDK` and fails configuration when `third_party/MAVSDK` is
  missing, so no build can produce a NOMAD binary with no way to reach a vehicle.
  The ROS 2 adapter builds `make_mavsdk_connection` instead of
  `UdpMavlinkConnection` and gains a declared `system_id` parameter; `--transport
  mavsdk` selector; the current CLI has no transport selector and does not read
  `NOMAD_TRANSPORT`, so naming the selector fails closed with usage. No path
  retains a hidden fallback.
  (2026-09-12)
- [core] `VehicleState` carries steady-clock timestamps for position, battery, GPS,
  and attitude samples; `Vehicle::wait_for_location` and `Vehicle::wait_for_altitude`
  fail closed when the position sample is older than the configured
  `position_freshness_timeout` (default 2000 ms) — closes hazard H-10 for the
  position field. The other three timestamps are stamped but not yet gated.
- [plugin,infra] Flight-controller-generic naming: `CubeOutputController` is
  renamed `OutputController` (it drives generic ArduPilot `DO_SET_SERVO` /
  `DO_SET_RELAY` outputs on any board); the services-status key
  `no_cubepilot` / `cubepilot_present` became `no_flight_controller` /
  `flight_controller_present` on both the edge_core route and the plugin
  panel; profiles and deployment wording no longer name a specific board.
  USB device-id matching in `mavlink_router.sh` intentionally still lists
  real vendor by-id strings (CubePilot, Pixhawk, Holybro, mRo, CUAV,
  RadioLink, ArduPilot) to discover any ArduPilot flight controller.
- [plugin] `CubeOutputController` no longer falls back to the edge_core REST
  vehicle routes (`/api/servo/channel/*/pwm`, `/api/servo/shooter/arm`,
  `/api/servo/shooter/trigger`) — the last C# consumers of the `payload` and
  `mavlink` REST modules (deletion-gate step 2, 2026-09-05). Servo and payload
  release now fail closed when neither the core client nor a live MAVLink
  link is available; `SendServoPwmAsync` became a plain `Task<bool>` wrapper.
- [core] The MAVLink codec no longer hand-maintains dialect tables.
  `third_party/ardupilot-mavlink` is pinned as a submodule at the exact commit
  Copter 4.7.1 compiles against, and `scripts/dev/generate_mavlink.py` runs the
  submodule's own mavgen to produce headers into the gitignored build dir
  (`build/generated/mavlink`, wired into CMake). `src/mavlink/protocol.cpp`
  and `fence.cpp` now use the generated message ids, crc_extras, lengths, and
  per-message pack/decode; NOMAD still owns framing, CRC verification, and the
  send -> ack -> state-verify semantics. Golden wire-frame tests are
  byte-identical (all pass unchanged), and the full `core-sitl-*` battery
  re-passes on Copter 4.7.1 (status, command-flow, mission,
  velocity-watchdog, geofence upload/readback, payload). Regenerate after any
  ArduPilot bump with `pixi run generate-mavlink`.
- [dev] ArduPilot SITL image updated from Copter 4.7.0 to **Copter 4.7.1**
  (`nomad-sitl:copter-4.7.1`, built from the `Copter-4.7.1` tag; the CI
  `sitl.yml` build args and docker-compose reference the new tag). All nine
  `core-sitl-*` scenarios re-verified on 4.7.1 (status, command-flow with
  verified goto, mission, velocity-watchdog, geofence upload/readback,
  payload, link-loss, link-recovery) — no wire behavior changes were needed.
  The dev stack now always forwards a MAVLink copy to host UDP 14572 so the
  link-recovery scenario's relay works without restarting the stack with a
  special `NOMAD_CORE_SITL_PORT`.

### Added
- [dev] Watch SITL runs live in Mission Planner: every `core-sitl-*` scenario
  now prints a hint pointing at the dev stack's operator MAVLink link
  (Mission Planner → CONNECT → TCP → 127.0.0.1:5762, via the compose
  `mp_bridge`). The link is a passive multi-client observer, verified to
  stream MAVLink v2 to the host without disturbing scenarios or the core CLI;
  documented in `tests/sitl/README.md` and `docs/development.md`.
- Core output verbs: `servo <channel> <pwm_us>`, `relay <number> <0|1>`,
  `motor-test <instance> <pwm_us> <timeout_s>`, `gimbal-config <mount_mode>`
  and `user-command <7 values>` CLI commands backed by new `Vehicle` methods
  (`set_relay`, `motor_test`, `configure_gimbal`, `send_user_command`;
  `set_servo` moved to `src/vehicle/output.cpp`). Each validates its input
  (relay 0..15, PWM 500..2500, mount mode 0..4, finite parameters, motor-test
  timeout clamped 0.05..3.0 s) and verifies the ArduPilot acknowledgement.
- `NomadCoreClient` methods `Servo`, `SetRelay`, `MotorTest`, `GimbalConfigure`
  and `SendUserCommand` — fail-closed validation gates before spawn, pinned
  argument vectors in `NomadCoreClientTests`.
- [plugin] CubeOutputController discrete servo/relay commands and
  MotorMusicCommand now route through the C++ core client first
  (acknowledged + verified), with the direct MAVLink and REST paths kept as
  transitional fallbacks; `GimbalController.SetMode` (mount configure) is
  core-first. Dead plugin motor-test code (`SendMotorTestPwm*`,
  `MotorTestCommand`) deleted — the capability moved to the core `motor-test`
  verb. High-rate drag/stick streams stay on direct MAVLink by design
  (debt-noted; a core streaming verb is the follow-up).
- [test] ROS adapter command services: `tests/ros/test_nomad_ros_integration.py`
  grows five tests exercising `/nomad/arm`, `/nomad/disarm`, `/nomad/land`,
  `/nomad/rtl` and ACK-rejection against the stateful MAVLink responder —
  each command is sent through the core, acknowledged, and verified via the
  authoritative vehicle state (armed bit / custom mode), with
  `MAV_RESULT_FAILED` surfacing as a failed service response (8/8 in-image).
- [test] `tests/ros/mavlink_wire.py`: structural MAVLink v1/v2 frame decoding
  shared by the ROS integration tests (COMMAND_LONG ids, velocity setpoint
  vx), keeping the assertions independent of a MAVLink parser.
- `NomadCoreClient` (C# plugin): the Mission Planner-free client for the C++
  core CLI boundary — spawns the `nomad` binary with the pinned
  `goto <lat> <lon> <alt> --endpoint <ep>` vector (invariant-culture F7/F1
  formatting), fails closed on non-finite/out-of-range input and on an
  unavailable core, and passes the API key through as `NOMAD_API_KEY`.
- `pixi run test-plugin-core-client` (+ `scripts/build/test_plugin_core_client.ps1`,
  `mission_planner/tests/coreclient/NomadCoreClientTests.cs`): a `csc`
  assertion harness pinning the client boundary — argument vector, invariant
  formatting, lat/lon/alt validation gates, unavailable-core fail-closed, and
  the live CLI authentication gate (actuation without a key is refused before
  any socket work, exercised when the C++ binary is built). Added as a step in
  the `plugin-tests` CI job.
- [test] Video feed/player coverage: `tests/test_mediamtx_config.py` pins the
  single-stream / multi-consumer MediaMTX contract (exactly one `publisher`,
  always-on path; no primary/secondary), and `tests/test_simple_video_bridge.py`
  gains pipeline-content assertions (single `/stream` target, x264
  `zerolatency`/`latency=0`, resolution/bitrate/fps) plus a rapid-switch
  stability test (60 back-to-back topic switches leave exactly one live pipeline)
  and a same-topic-is-a-no-op (seamless) check.
- `GimbalCommand` (C# plugin): the pure, Mission-Planner-free core of the gimbal
  control — the `DO_MOUNT_CONTROL`/`DO_MOUNT_CONFIGURE` command frames sent to
  ArduPilot plus the stick-integration and angle-clamping math, extracted from
  `GimbalController` so it is unit-testable offline (the `PayloadReleaseInterlock`/
  `GeoMath` idiom). `GimbalController` now delegates to it and just maps the frame
  onto `MAVLink.MAV_CMD` for the send.
- `pixi run test-plugin-gimbal` (+ `scripts/build/test_plugin_gimbal.ps1`,
  `mission_planner/tests/gimbal/GimbalCommandTests.cs`): a `csc` assertion harness
  pinning the exact MAVLink the gimbal emits — command ids (205/204), the param
  layout (P1=pitch, P2=roll, P7=MAVLINK_TARGETING; P1=mode), `MAV_MOUNT_MODE`
  values, and the integrator/clamp math. Added as a step in the `plugin-tests`
  CI job.
- `pixi run sitl-gimbal` (+ `tests/sitl/gimbal_mount_control.py` and its skipped
  pytest wrapper): an end-to-end SITL scenario that configures a servo mount on a
  live ArduPilot, sends the same `DO_MOUNT_CONFIGURE`/`DO_MOUNT_CONTROL` commands,
  and asserts the mount tracks the commanded pitch and reaches the configured
  limit — read back from the reported attitude (`GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS`)
  or, on builds that don't publish it, the mount's servo output. Wired into the
  nightly `sitl.yml` as the last scenario (it reboots the shared vehicle to apply
  `MNT1_TYPE`).
- Shared responsive-UI foundation for the Mission Planner plugin (`mission_planner/src/UI/`):
  typography + spacing constants and font helpers on `NOMADTheme`
  (`Font()`/`Mono()`, `SIZE_*`, `PAD`/`GAP`, named `CONTROL_BG`/`PANEL_ALT`
  surfaces), plus reflowing builders on `ControlFactory` (`Card`, `LabeledRow`,
  `ButtonRow`, `SectionTitle`, themed `CheckBox`/`Numeric`/`TabControl`/`ListBox`,
  and the `BoundaryGrid` skin). These replace the per-view ad-hoc fonts/colors and
  absolute positioning, so the subsequent view-layout work sizes dynamically to
  any aspect ratio without overlap.
- `PayloadReleaseInterlock` (C# plugin, tier SC): the pure, UI-free arm→confirm
  state machine behind every multi-click-armed payload release on the ground
  station (drop servos + momentary relay/pump fire). N deliberate clicks within a
  rolling window authorize exactly one actuation, then it disarms; a click after
  the window lapses (or a backwards clock) restarts the count.
- `pixi run test-plugin-interlock` (+ `scripts/build/test_plugin_interlock.ps1`):
  a standalone Roslyn (`csc`) assertion harness covering the interlock
  arm/fire/rolling-window-expiry/backwards-clock/reset paths — the GCS
  counterpart of `tests/test_safety_payload.py`, in the same framework-free idiom
  as the existing `test-plugin-geometry`/`-duallink` tests. A new `plugin-tests`
  job in `.github/workflows/csharp.yml` runs the interlock and geometry harnesses
  on `windows-latest` (no .NET SDK, NuGet, or staged Mission Planner needed) —
  the first plugin unit tests to gate in CI.
- `StateManager` and `TimeSyncService` unit coverage: the 10 Hz model-rebuild
  batching contract (immediate vs. rate-limited snapshots, forced updates) and
  the NTP/GPS time-sync status machine (`timedatectl`/socket reachability,
  GPS-offset estimation, `force_sync_from_gps` success/fallback/error paths, the
  monitor loop, and the module lifecycle) — all with subprocess, socket, and the
  system clock mocked. Raises the `pixi run test` coverage floor 60% -> 65%
  (66% actual).
- Simple video bridge fallback + entrypoint coverage (`tests/test_simple_video_bridge.py`):
  the appsrc GStreamer fallback (with bindings present and absent), the
  python-subprocess pipeline (success/failure), the kill-after-terminate-fails
  teardown branch, and `main()` (serve-then-shutdown and Ctrl-C) — taking
  `services/ros/simple_video_bridge.py` to 99% (only the `__main__` guard left).
  Raises the `pixi run test` coverage floor 84% -> 85% (85.40% actual).
- `MavlinkCommands` unit coverage (`tests/test_mavlink_commands.py`): the MAVLink
  command builders driven with a fake pymavlink link and the command-ack sender
  stubbed — the `_send_guarded` link guard (no-connection / None-result /
  truthy-falsy / exception), `arm_disarm`, `trigger_payload`, `set_relay`,
  `set_mode`/`land`, `takeoff`, `request_home_position`, velocity (default/custom
  frame, `stop_velocity`), `send_statustext` (truncation + severity), and the
  global/local position targets (link guard + yaw mask; fence gating stays in
  `test_mavlink_fence`) — taking `services/mavlink/commands.py` to **100%** (total
  84.70%). `cov-safety` unchanged (no SC source touched).
- Payload actuation I/O coverage (`tests/test_payload_servo_io.py`,
  `tests/test_payload_module.py`): the non-safety MAVLink-I/O surface of the servo
  adapter — `MavlinkServo` (channel validation, angle clamp/transmit, PWM validate/
  no-link/result, pulse mapping), `ServoController` (camera tilt config + last-angle
  preservation, status, lifecycle, defensive branches), the module-global
  controller helpers, and the `PayloadModule` arm/trigger command routes (200/400/
  409/503) — taking `modules/payload/servo.py` and `services/payload_module.py`
  both to **100%**. The SR-PAY-01/02/03 fault-injection guarantees stay in
  `tests/test_payload_servo.py`; `cov-safety` remains 100%. Raises the `pixi run
  test` coverage floor 82% -> 84% (84.24% actual).
- `TailscaleManager` unit coverage (`tests/test_tailscale_manager.py`): the
  Tailscale status poller exercised with the module-level `_run` wrapper stubbed —
  the `parse_status_json` state map + IPv4 extraction, `_check_status`
  (not-installed/error/parsed/bad-JSON), `_reconnect` (`tailscale up` ok/fail),
  the auto-reconnect monitor loop, and the thread lifecycle — taking
  `infra/tailscale/tailscale_manager.py` from 72% to **100%** (total 82.62%).
- `NetworkMonitor` unit coverage (`tests/test_network_monitor.py`): the 4G/LTE
  modem + connectivity monitor exercised with the module-level `_run` shell
  wrapper stubbed to a command-dispatching fake — the `nmcli`/`mmcli`/`ip`/`ping`
  parsers (RSRP→quality/percent, NM connection lookup + fuzzy LTE-profile
  heuristics, ModemManager modem read with signal/bearer fallbacks, interface
  guessing, ping RTT), the NM+MM merge in `_check_modem_status`, `check_connectivity`,
  and the thread lifecycle — taking `infra/tailscale/network_monitor.py` from 42%
  to **100%**. Raises the `pixi run test` coverage floor 78% -> 82% (82.06% actual).
- `VideoStreamManager` unit coverage (`tests/test_video_stream_manager.py`): the
  in-container video-bridge controller driven with `subprocess.run` (a
  docker-command-classifying stub) and `urlopen` (a URL->payload map) faked —
  container/relay status probes, every `start_with_reason` failure branch (stale
  adopt, container down, missing script, `docker cp`/`exec` errors and timeout,
  crash/no-frames/uncheckable diagnosis), the crash-recovery watchdog loop
  (dead-bridge restart, stalled-pipeline `/restart`, relaunch fallbacks), and the
  switch-topic / overlay / status HTTP API — taking
  `services/video_stream_manager.py` from 40% to **100%**. Raises the `pixi run
  test` coverage floor 75% -> 78% (78.52% actual).
- `JetsonHealthMonitor` unit coverage (`tests/test_health_monitor.py`): the Jetson
  sysfs/proc readers and `tailscale` status exercised against a fake file system
  (scoped `open`/`os.path.exists`, mocked `os.statvfs`/`subprocess`/`time.sleep`)
  — temperature/CPU-load/GPU-load-EMA/memory/disk/power(INA3221)/throttle/fan
  parsing, the tailscale cache, the `_update_health` orchestration + state push,
  and the thread lifecycle/module wiring — taking `services/health_monitor.py`
  from 27% to **100%**. Raises the `pixi run test` coverage floor 70% -> 75%
  (75.41% actual).
- `MavlinkConnection` unit coverage (`tests/test_mavlink_connection.py`): the FC
  receiver loop driven with `mavutil.mavlink_connection` patched to a scripted
  fake link — endpoint-scheme normalization, the per-message-type dispatch
  (HEARTBEAT arm/mode, SYS_STATUS, GLOBAL_POSITION_INT with/without fix,
  HOME_POSITION, ATTITUDE, SYSTEM_TIME, COMMAND_ACK, SERVO_OUTPUT_RAW), the
  reconnect-on-`None` path, the disconnect watchdog (`LOST` transition), the
  command-ack wait/confirm/timeout, and the health-broadcast loop — taking
  `services/mavlink/connection.py` from 23% to **100%**. Raises the `pixi run
  test` coverage floor 65% -> 70% (70.31% actual).
- `edge_core.ros_http_bridge.vio_math` (+ `tests/test_vio_math.py`): the VIO
  pose/frame math lifted out of the rclpy-only `node.py` into a pure, 100%-covered
  module — covariance→confidence, the REP-103→NED position/velocity/attitude sign
  conventions, the tilt-compensated magnetometer heading (incl. its degenerate
  no-update cases), and the gimbal-camera→drone-body pose composition. 17 tests
  pin the flight-relevant signs that were previously unreachable by the suite.
- `docker/Dockerfile.jetson` (+ `docker/ros_entrypoint.sh`): the on-board Jetson
  perception/odometry image, layered on the Isaac ROS dev base — ZED SDK 5.2.3,
  GStreamer, the ZED/nvblox/nav2 ROS2 runtime, `isaac_ros_nvblox_utils`, and the
  self-contained NOMAD ROS-HTTP bridge. Resolves the previously dangling
  `docker/Dockerfile.jetson` references in `.github/workflows/docker.yml` and
  `docs/deployment.md`; the Jetson deployment docs were corrected to describe the
  image accurately (perception container on the Isaac ROS base, not an
  all-in-one) and note the `BASE_IMAGE` prerequisite.

### Changed
- [ros2] [ci] `docker/Dockerfile.sim-ros` now compiles `nomad_core` +
  `nomad_ros` into a colcon workspace (`/ws/install`, sourced by the
  entrypoint), replacing the image's Python-only runtime. The root CMake's
  CTest targets are gated on the `tests/` tree so the subproject build stays
  clean without it.
- [ros2] [test] `tests/ros/test_ros_bridge_integration.py` (Python HTTP
  bridge against a stub) is replaced by
  `tests/ros/test_nomad_ros_integration.py`: it runs the real C++
  `nomad_vehicle_node` against an in-process pymavlink MAVLink responder and
  asserts typed telemetry publication, the fail-closed VIO gate (no feed →
  no setpoint), and that a healthy VIO feed + `/nomad/cmd_vel` delivers a
  FLU-to-FRD `SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED` (vx ~= 1.0) to the vehicle.
  `ros-sim.yml` and `pixi run test-ros-integration` now run this suite; the
  workflow triggers now cover the core + adapter sources. The Python bridge
  deletion remains gated on its Jetson/GPU/systemd deployment tail
  (docs/migration.md Phase 7).
- [core] [transport] `wait_for_state` now consumes the entire pending queue
  per call instead of stopping at the first telemetry frame, and
  `receive_message` drains new datagrams even when the queue is non-empty. A
  slow sampler (the ROS node's telemetry timer at a few hertz) previously fell
  behind the MAVProxy stream, leaving heartbeats unread behind a backlog so
  on-demand freshness checks reported a healthy link as stale and every
  velocity command was refused. Found by the live ROS-against-SITL proof;
  covered by a link-flood regression test in `tests/udp_connection_test.cpp`.
- [ros2] [fix] `nomad_vehicle_node` never set `vio_sample_.updated` in its
  VIO health/confidence callbacks, so `take_latest_vio_sample` always reported
  no feed and every `/nomad/cmd_vel` was refused with "without a VIO feed".
  The flags are now set on each callback; the node drove the live Copter 4.7.0
  SITL vehicle over `/nomad/cmd_vel` end-to-end after the fix.
- [ros2] `nomad_ros` compiles and passes its 12 translation unit tests in a
  ROS 2 Humble image; the live-feed half of deletion-gate step 1
  (docs/migration.md Phase 7) is closed.
- [hardware] NOMAD is no longer documented or discovered as Cube-Orange-specific:
  it targets ArduPilot on any flight controller. The mavlink-router USB discovery
  (`scripts/services/mavlink_router.sh`) now matches common ArduPilot boards
  (Pixhawk, Holybro, mRo, CUAV, RadioLink, ArduPilot) in addition to Cube, and
  plugin payload wording/config comments describe generic ArduPilot
  servo/relay channels (`DO_SET_SERVO` / `DO_SET_RELAY`) rather than Cube
  outputs; the C++ core already used only board-independent MAVLink and
  SERVO1-16/RELAY channels.
- [plugin] [boundary] `GuidedGoto` (BoundaryManager soft-boundary return) now
  routes through `NomadCoreClient` to the C++ core CLI instead of the plugin's
  MAVLink path: the core sends MAV_CMD_DO_REPOSITION with the change-mode flag
  and verifies the arrival position, so a "return to boundary" means the
  vehicle is actually at the target. `FlightModeController.Initialize(config)`
  is wired into plugin load; the dead reflection tail, `SetMember`, and the
  caller-less `SetGuidedMode` were deleted.
- [plugin] Flight Boundaries view spacing tightened further (smaller card
  padding, inter-card margin, section-title gap, and row gaps) so the SOFT/HARD
  boundary and IMPORT/EXPORT sections pack closely without needless scrolling.
- [edge] [plugin] The Jetson now exposes a **single** RTSP stream at the
  canonical path `stream` — replacing the old `/primary` + `/secondary` (and the
  legacy `zed`/`live`/`dynamic`/wildcard) paths. MediaMTX serves it from one
  always-on `source: publisher` path, so any number of viewers can read it
  concurrently while the content (which ROS topic) is switched live via the
  bridge API. The video bridge (`--rtsp-path`/default), `VideoStreamManager`
  default URL, the `/api/video/bridges` JSON key (`primary` → `stream`),
  `/api/stream/info`, the plugin's RTSP URLs + status read, and the env/docs are
  all aligned on `stream`.
- Dashboard notifications header (`NotificationPanel`) relaid out as a docked
  AutoSize table (title/unread badge left, Clear right) instead of absolute
  positions with a resize handler, and its fonts routed through `NOMADTheme`.
  Completes the responsive sweep of the operator-facing views — the remaining
  views (Video/Terminal/Calibration) are already docked, the Dashboard is a
  percentage `TableLayoutPanel`, and the Settings dialog is an intentionally
  fixed-size `FixedDialog` with `AutoScroll` tabs.
- Health + Links panels relaid out responsively: `ServiceControlPanel` (services
  as a reflowing name/status/buttons table + percentage log split, no fixed
  920×650), `LinkHealthPanel` (header and settings rows are AutoSize cards with
  wrapping flows instead of hardcoded x-positions that overlapped at narrow
  widths), and `EnhancedHealthDashboard` (status + metrics panels as tables so the
  progress bars stretch and values never clip). All routed through the shared
  `NOMADTheme`/`ControlFactory` helpers; behaviour unchanged.
- Flight Boundaries view relaid out responsively: the fixed-height cards with
  absolutely-positioned children are now AutoSize cards of full-width rows
  (wrapping button/control clusters, explicit-height grids), routed through the
  shared `NOMADTheme`/`ControlFactory` helpers. Fixes overlap and clipping at
  narrow widths / non-default aspect ratios; behaviour and all persisted settings
  are unchanged (the cross-partial `Controls.Find(...)` named controls are kept).
- Gimbal control de-branded from "Caddx" to a generic gimbal (window title,
  sidebar button, file headers/comments) so it drives any `DO_MOUNT_CONTROL`
  mount, and the floating joystick window relaid out with a docked
  `TableLayoutPanel` — a fill joystick pad plus AutoSize rows and wrapping button
  rows — so it fits any window size/aspect ratio without overlap. The `MountMode`
  enum is now shared (was duplicated across `GimbalController` and the window).
- `PayloadControlPanel` (drop + momentary-relay rows) now delegates its
  arm/confirm decision to `PayloadReleaseInterlock`, keeping only the rendering
  and visual-revert timer. Closes the rearchitecture §3.3 GAP "payload release
  logic still mixed with panel chrome" (`docs/safety/partition.md`); behaviour is
  unchanged (3-click drop, 2-click relay fire, 3 s window). Also disposes the
  relay-fire reset timers on teardown (previously leaked).
- The ROS-HTTP bridge node (`ros_http_bridge.node`) is now a thin ROS adapter:
  its `_handle_vio`/`_handle_mag`/`_get_drone_body_pose` callbacks delegate the
  frame and pose arithmetic to the new `vio_math` module instead of computing it
  inline. Behaviour-preserving; the only untested file left in the bridge package
  shrinks to message unpacking and HTTP forwarding.

### Fixed
- [core] [bug] `Vehicle::motor_test` sent MAVLink command ID 139, which is not a
  `MAV_CMD` entry at all in the pinned dialect — `MAV_CMD_DO_MOTOR_TEST` is 209
  — so no autopilot handler matched it and the verb could never work. Live A/B
  against Copter 4.7.1: id 139 drew `MAV_RESULT_UNSUPPORTED`, id 209 drew
  `MAV_RESULT_ACCEPTED` with the vehicle's own "starting motor test" /
  "finished motor test" status texts. `tests/test_command_ids.py` now resolves
  every hand-typed command id in `src/vehicle/` against the pinned dialect
  definition, which is the check that would have caught it, and the MAVSDK peer
  fixture covers the verb. See C23.
- [mavlink] [bug] The 1 Hz GCS heartbeat that opens heartbeat-gated relays was
  emitted only once per `wait_for_heartbeat` call: the loop announced, then
  blocked in a single receive for the whole remaining timeout. A relay that
  stayed closed saw one announcement instead of the 1 Hz cadence, so
  `core-sitl-gcs-heartbeat`'s negative control (which requires four announcements
  across three measured intervals) failed. The
  receive is now capped at a 20 ms slice — the same pattern `wait_for_state`
  already used — and the unit test drives one long 6 s wait as the CLI does, so
  the cadence is pinned inside a single blocking call.
- [dev,sitl] [bug] The `sitl-fence` task could never pass. It was the only
  scenario task without the development API key, and every step of the
  containment scenario is an actuation command the CLI refuses without one
  (`audit command=... result=refused auth=none reason=missing_api_key`), so
  local runs and the `sitl.yml` step both failed at the first `mode` command.
  The task now sets the key like the other `core-sitl-*` runners.
- [sitl,infra] [bug] The dev SITL stack no longer starves the C++ core of
  telemetry. ArduPilot streams position, attitude and extended status only
  after a GCS requests the group, and the core deliberately never requests
  streams, so with the Python edge service deleted the host-side copy the
  `core-sitl-*` scenarios read carried little more than heartbeats — status,
  takeoff and goto verification could not pass. `docker/sitl-streams.parm` now
  sets `SR0_POSITION`, `SR0_EXT_STAT`, `SR0_EXTRA1` and `SR0_EXTRA2` at startup
  via `--add-param-file`, and the host copy delivers heartbeat at 1.00 Hz with
  position/GPS/attitude/status at ~4 Hz.
- [core] [bug] The UDP MAVLink transport was single-consumer: with a
  concurrent telemetry pump (the ROS node's 10 Hz timer) a command
  acknowledgement could be consumed before `send_command`'s waiter saw it,
  timing out commands that a single-threaded CLI never lost.
  `send_command` now holds the receive mutex for the whole exchange and the
  receive/state helpers use locked variants; the fence helpers follow. Found
  by the new ROS command-service tests.
- [plugin] [bug] Gimbal joystick window keeps the NOMAD theme when it loses focus
  — Mission Planner's `ThemeManager` recolors plugin windows on every
  activation/deactivation (turning the buttons grey/green and the background
  light), so the window now re-asserts its palette on focus changes (the same
  pattern the main screen uses). This also fixes the "Center 0°/0°" and
  "Look Down −90°" preset buttons that were left green.
- [plugin] [bug] Gimbal joystick PITCH/ROLL axis labels sit just outside the ring
  in a reserved gutter — clear of the circle without spilling past the pad edge.

### Removed
- [infra] The separate `/primary` and `/secondary` MediaMTX stream paths (and the
  legacy `zed`/`live`/`dynamic` + wildcard `all_others` paths) — collapsed into
  the single `stream` path.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- ROS-HTTP bridge unit coverage: the `simple_video_bridge` GStreamer pipeline
  lifecycle and HTTP API routing, plus the `mavlink_velocity` connection,
  setpoint-TX, watchdog, and heartbeat-gating paths and the `mesh_packer`
  background sender loop.
- Edge Core API route coverage: the system/network endpoints (health, status,
  network, ping, `/ws/state`), the `services` status fan-out, the whitelisted
  `terminal` runner, and the `calibration`/`isaac` management modules — all
  driven through `TestClient` with subprocess and hardware probes mocked. The
  `pixi run test` coverage floor rises 45% -> 60%.
- CI now compiles the Mission Planner plugin on a `windows-latest` runner
  (`.github/workflows/csharp.yml`): it stages a version-pinned portable Mission
  Planner so the csproj's DLL HintPaths resolve, then builds with MSBuild — a
  real gate (no SDK needed) catching broken references/syntax that the
  whitespace-only `dotnet format` job could not. Triggered on `mission_planner/`
  changes; uploads `NOMADPlugin.dll` as a build artifact.
- Mission Planner plugin release packaging (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): on
  a `v*` tag, the plugin is built and published as a GitHub Release asset — a
  small zip (`NOMADPlugin.dll` + `INSTALL.ps1` + `README.md`) plus the bare DLL —
  so users can install it without cloning or building. `INSTALL.ps1` copies the
  DLL into the per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mission Planner\plugins` folder (no admin)
  and warns about a stale Program Files duplicate.

### Changed
- Type-checking the safety-critical core is now an enforced CI gate. `edge_core/safety`
  is checked under strict mypy settings (`disallow_untyped_defs` et al.) via the new
  `pixi run typecheck-safety` task, and the lint workflow fails on a type regression
  there. The whole-tree mypy run stays advisory — same asymmetric rigor as
  `cov-safety`/`lint-safety`.
- Mission Planner plugin C# sources are now globbed
  (`<Compile Include="**\*.cs">`) instead of being listed file-by-file, so new
  files and partial-class splits build without hand-editing the csproj. It stays
  a plain MSBuild project (no .NET SDK prerequisite, unlike SDK-style).
- All GitHub Actions workflows pinned to Node-24 action releases ahead of GitHub
  forcing Node 24 on 2026-06-16 and removing Node 20 on 2026-09-16: `checkout` v5,
  `setup-pixi` v0.9.6, `setup-buildx-action` v4, `build-push-action` v7,
  `upload-artifact` v6, `cache` v5, `setup-dotnet` v5, `login-action` v4,
  `metadata-action` v6, `action-gh-release` v3, `configure-pages` v6,
  `upload-pages-artifact` v4, `deploy-pages` v5, `setup-msbuild` v3.
- Safety case docs brought in line with verification reality. The geofence
  containment SITL scenario (`pixi run sitl-fence`) is recorded as run & passing
  (2026-06-11, commit f69a137) and now gating nightly, so SR-FEN-02's loop-closure
  evidence is ✅; SR-FEN-01 (FC-side fence upload) is marked met (verified
  manually before flight); and the SC/NC partition rule is documented as enforced
  by `tests/test_safety_partition.py` rather than a stated intention — leaving no
  open requirements (🟡 0, 🔴 0) in the Python SC tier.
- README quick-start fixed: the `pixi`-install lines sat outside the code fence
  and rendered as oversized headings; install and run steps are now two clean
  fenced blocks.

### Fixed
- [tests] [bug] SITL scenarios now land and disarm before takeoff, so the
  nightly `sitl-fence` job no longer times out waiting for a climb when it
  starts while the prior `sitl-scenario` flight is still returning (RTL). Each
  scenario establishes its own clean ground state, independent of run order.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `vio` route module (`/api/vio/*`): VIO status and trajectory endpoints fed
  by the ROS-HTTP bridge.
- Boot, VIO, auth-middleware, geospatial, coordinate-math, mesh-packer, and
  MAVLink-velocity unit tests; an api_reference ↔ OpenAPI drift guard.
- Contract gates now verify HTTP verbs for Mission Planner and ROS bridge
  callers, with `KNOWN_DRIFT` burned down to zero rows.
- `pytest-cov` coverage reporting in `pixi run test` with a ratcheting floor.
- `ModuleRegistry.wire_safe()` — the single, fault-isolated module-wiring path.
- `TailscaleManager.reconnect()` (fixes a latent `AttributeError` in the
  auto-reconnect loop); `infra/tailscale` is now type-checked by mypy.
- `video` and `network` modules now own the video-stream and Tailscale/network
  monitor lifecycles through the `nomad.modules` entry-point system.

### Changed
- Module lifecycle now runs through an ASGI `lifespan` context manager instead
  of the deprecated FastAPI `@app.on_event` hooks.
- Edge Core route parsing now uses Pydantic request models for VIO,
  calibration, and spray settings instead of ad hoc JSON reads.
- Camera-tilt control now round-trips a float angle via POST and GET, matching
  both Mission Planner and ROS bridge callers.
- Video and actuator routes use FastAPI error envelopes consistently instead of
  HTTP 200 responses with `{"success": false}`.
- Mission Planner HTTP sender plumbing, service command lookup, ground-link
  router state, and payload async command paths were consolidated and hardened.
- Edge Core fails fast on module-wiring errors outside sim mode (was: log and
  continue half-wired).
- `E501` (line length) is now enforced; `ruff`, pre-commit, and CI pinned to the
  same versions; `setup-pixi` unified across workflows.
- Docs dev server moved to `:8001` to avoid clashing with `pixi run dev`.
- VS Code Docker/Isaac-Sim tasks now call the `pixi run` tasks (one source of
  truth) and the default build task is the cross-platform lint.
- Competition-specific wording removed from code; one-off hardware bring-up
  scripts moved to `scripts/dev/archive/`.
- Oversized Mission Planner C# files split to stay under the 800-line cap
  (`MapOverlayManager`, `LinkHealthPanel`, `NotificationService`,
  `NOMADConfig`).

### Removed
- Verified-dead Python and C# control surfaces from the refactor audit,
  including the unused IPC/logging/operational-mode services, the old
  IsaacROSBridge class, stale VIO/SLAM/admin client calls, and vestigial
  `NOMAD_ENABLE_VISION`, `SERVO_MODE`, and `UseELRS` configuration.
- Isaac Sim (Omniverse) integration — the `Dockerfile.isaac_sim`,
  `docker-compose.sim.yml`, `docker/isaac_sim/` launch scripts, the `isaac_sim`
  route module, the pixi `sim` feature/environment + `sim-*` tasks, the `sim`
  config profile, and all `ISAAC_SIM_MODE` branches. It needs a high-end GPU we
  don't have yet and will return later as a remote simulation server. The
  hardware-free dev stack (Edge Core + ArduPilot SITL) and the on-Jetson Isaac
  ROS bridge are unaffected.
- `tests/test_p3_7_debounce.py` (competition-specific, permanently skipped).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Initial public baseline: reusable drone edge (FastAPI companion-computer
  service) + Mission Planner ground-control plugin, with the module SDK,
  MAVLink/ROS bridges, video streaming, health monitoring, and payload
  actuation.
