"""Pin the MAV_CMD ids the vehicle layer puts on the wire to the pinned dialect.

``src/vehicle/command_ids.hpp`` hand-types the MAV_CMD identifiers the vehicle
layer sends. An id that no autopilot handler matches fails silently rather than
loudly: the command is reported as sent while the vehicle does nothing. C23 was
exactly that — motor test sent 139, which is not a MAV_CMD entry at all, while
``MAV_CMD_DO_MOTOR_TEST`` is 209.

The dialect read here is the pinned ``third_party/ardupilot-mavlink``
submodule's own definition, which is the firmware dialect NOMAD targets, so an
id that drifts from that dialect fails the gate. The submodule stays pinned for
this gate even though the transport builds its frames with MAVSDK's own codec.
