# MAVSDK Phase A dependency inventory

This inventory records the optional Phase A build inputs at the reviewed NOMAD
gitlink. It is an engineering and notice audit, not a release approval. The
production core does not use MAVSDK yet.
The CONOPS v1.0 reconciliation did not change dependency pins or accepted evidence.
MAVSDK remains a project prerequisite, not an organizer-prescribed library.
Competition transport/traffic requirements do not justify adding speculative
network plugins: obtain the official server contract first. Re-audit this
inventory when production parity adds required MAVSDK plugins or changes build
options; the telemetry-only Phase A inventory cannot cover those future inputs.

The Phase A build disables the MAVSDK server and curl, so their optional
dependency sets are outside this inventory. MAVSDK's patched MAVLink build uses
the pymavlink generator source nested in the pinned MAVLink checkout instead of
running a build-time `pip install`; generator packages are not linked into the
smoke executable.

The checker `pixi run check-mavsdk-phase-a` fails if reviewed gitlinks,
dependency references, archive hashes/timestamp handling, the pinned-generator
patch, NOTICE component names, or any bundled licence text changes without an
explicit audit update. The complete selected-build texts and their checked hashes
are in `licenses/mavsdk-phase-a/`. MAVSDK-Proto is not fetched, compiled or linked
while the server remains disabled; enabling it requires a new audit.

## Hardening evidence - 2026-09-10

The project MAVSDK fork is pinned at
`9884f109533f564bc6250e5471e6301d3a62f4a7`. The fork replaces the mutable
PicoSHA2 branch with an immutable commit, adds SHA-256 archive checks for
liblzma and nlohmann JSON, handles deterministic archive extraction on both
pre-3.24 and newer CMake, and removes MAVLink's build-time network package
resolution in favor of its pinned nested pymavlink generator source. NOMAD pins
that revision directly so a recursive clean checkout resolves the reviewed graph.

Recursive hosted test run `34535620056` passed the optional MAVSDK build,
provenance checker and deterministic expected/wrong/absent-peer fixture on both
Ubuntu and Windows, alongside the Python and C++ core suites. Selected ROS-image
run `34538394497` built the pinned graph with NOMAD_ENABLE_MAVSDK=ON and passed
the ROS adapter integration tests. Mainline SITL run `34538903820` built an
ArduPilot Copter 4.7.1 image and passed the live MAVSDK Phase A connect/status
smoke. These results establish current clean-checkout and hosted build evidence
for the reviewed Phase A graph; they do not qualify later plugin additions,
production cutover or aircraft hardware.

The historical warm Windows build tree was 379,308,757 bytes and the smoke
executable was 2,032,128 bytes. These are one-machine diagnostics, not approved
budgets or clean-build benchmarks. Current build-tree, executable, runtime memory,
startup and CI-time measurements still need repeatable collection and explicit
budget approval before Phase A closes.

The build task now emits configure/build durations and footprint values together,
and the hosted Linux/Windows jobs retain the JSON record. Local collector checks
on 2026-09-10 used a dirty `34b417d4` vendor checkout and therefore remain
diagnostic; its provenance check failed the pinned-generator marker. Accepted
samples must come from the reviewed gitlink in a recursive clean checkout.
Live smoke metrics now report per-process-tree peak RSS instead of the previous
cumulative child-process maximum, and their hosted output is retained separately.

Clean local Windows verification on 2026-09-10 used NOMAD `610215f`, the reviewed
MAVSDK gitlink `9884f109533f564bc6250e5471e6301d3a62f4a7`, MAVSDK-Proto
`1fd0bc7a05c21336227b1eab266b8b610401cf38`, ArduPilot MAVLink `288b907c` and
pymavlink `ec06837a`. Provenance, build, deterministic peer cases, 10 CTests and
345 Python tests passed; three ROS/SITL environment cases skipped. The measured
warm build values are recorded in the adoption decision. Hosted resource samples,
live runtime metrics and approved thresholds remain open.

Hosted run `34550522657` at commit `219133e` then retained clean Linux and
Windows build records. Linux measured a 213,615,930-byte tree, 4,719,032-byte
executable, 1,552,468 selected-archive bytes and 43.020/172.291 s
configure/build time. Windows measured a 430,393,315-byte tree, 2,015,744-byte
executable, 12,051,864 selected-archive bytes and 187.318/326.074 s
configure/build time. Both provenance audits and deterministic peer suites
passed. Live Copter 4.7.1 SITL run `34550529273` retained 0.731 s connect and
2.534 s status measurements with 9,584,640 and 9,940,992-byte peak process-tree
RSS respectively. Budget approval, aircraft evidence and flight qualification
remain open.

## Open release blockers

- Collect repeat samples for variance and profile-specific CI time; approve
  explicit build-tree, executable, runtime memory, startup and CI-time budgets.
- Re-run the selected dependency and licence audit whenever production parity
  enables another plugin, server, curl or test dependency.
- Requalify the hosted Linux/Windows, selected ROS and live ArduPilot SITL matrix
  whenever the MAVSDK pin, selected dependency graph or smoke contract changes.

debt: the selected-build graph is published, pinned and hosted-qualified; revisit
when resource budgets are approved and whenever dependency or MAVSDK plugin
selection changes.
