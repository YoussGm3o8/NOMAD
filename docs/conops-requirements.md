# CONOPS requirement inventory

This is the source appendix of [PRD](prd.md), not a second product plan.
Source: **2027-AEAC-CONOPS-v1.0-2026-09-08.pdf**, version 1.0, 2026-09-08,
36 pages, supplied by the project team and read completely before edits.

Page numbers below are printed PDF pages (also physical pages). No source PDF,
raw extraction, real deployment configuration or contact details are stored here.

Status C = confirmed statement in this version; I = interpretation requiring
approval; U = unresolved. Status describes provenance, never implementation
completion. Kind M = mandatory; S = scoring condition; P = permission; E =
environment/supplied input; R = recommendation. Permissions are not obligations
to exercise them. All IDs are permanent; retire rather than reuse them.
Safety H = directly safety relevant, M = supporting safety/evidence, L = mainly
administrative/scoring. Owner names are component or accountable team roles,
not a claim that software already exists. Every evidence cell is **required**
future acceptance evidence unless [migration](migration.md) explicitly records it.

## Interpretation register and deliberate exclusions

| ID | Source | Task/phase | Kind/status | Faithful requirement summary | Owner | Safety | Verification and evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AE27-INT-001 | 5.2.3(10) p21; 5.2.4 p23-26 | T2/battery swap | P/U | Only Task 1 explicitly prohibits swaps; Task 2 swap permission is not stated. | Competition lead | H | Written ruling before including swap in scored strategy; Q03/G6 |
| AE27-INT-002 | 4.7(h) p14; 5.2.3(4) p20 | T1/traffic response | P/I | Manual deconfliction appears permitted, but advisory display alone cannot satisfy actual exclusion-zone avoidance. | Safety lead / operator | H | Organizer confirmation if needed and timely avoidance witness; Q04/G4 |
| AE27-INT-003 | 5.2.3(2-4) p20 | Both/server design | E/U | Token portal referenced; CONOPS does not specify wire protocol, endpoint paths, event schema, delivery/retry or outage policy; Task 2 server obligation not explicit. | Competition adapter | H | Versioned official contract and server acceptance; Q04/G4 |
| AE27-INT-004 | 5.2.3(8-9) p21 | T1/evidence | E/C | Required survey submission is text; no task imagery upload or bounding-box submission specified. Images remain project verification evidence. | Perception / evidence tools | L | Required text export plus separately retained internal imagery; G5 |

Appendices A/B are glossary/contact reference; F has no answered questions in
v1.0. Appendix E pp33-35 explicitly labels its advice non-binding, including
60-minute arrival and 10-minute-ready suggestions; these do not replace the
30-minute scored arrival criterion. Its project-management wording supports the
scored proposal plan, not a newly invented flight requirement. Table 9 is reused
for Phase 2 totals and Phase 3 scoring; citations include page numbers.

No CONOPS requirement selects MAVSDK, Jetson, ROS, LTE, Walksnail, a mission
camera, ZED, ESP32, Cube Orange, Here4, RTK or VIO. These remain project decisions
or deferred choices in PRD. Event-driven competition uploads from the preview
are not confirmed here. No prediction horizon, right-of-way algorithm, alert UI,
traffic freshness bound or mandated autonomous avoidance maneuver is specified.
Do not infer those from the cylindrical exclusion-zone obligation.
