# Development

The current tree builds a C++20 library and CLI with optional ROS 2 and Mission
Planner adapters. Edge Core source is deleted and active build, deployment and
setup entrypoints target the C++ core. Source status and evidence belong in
[migration](migration.md).

## Prerequisites and verified local checks

Use Git, Pixi, CMake (3.22.1 or newer) and a C++20 compiler, and initialize the
submodules: the transport is the pinned `third_party/MAVSDK` checkout, and CMake
fails configuration when it is missing. The MAVSDK build fetches its own pinned
dependencies, so a first configure needs network access. C++ runtime use does not
require Python, ROS or a GPU.

~~~sh
pixi run test-core
pixi run test-python
pixi run lint
pixi run format-check
pixi run complexity-check
pixi run docs-build
pixi run package-core
pixi run verify-core-install
pixi run verify-core-package
~~~

test-core configures/builds before CTest; build-core builds without tests.
format-check is read-only with respect to source; format rewrites source and is
not appropriate for a documentation-only review of unrelated migration work.
docs-build is the strict ProperDocs site check.
The package tasks are non-deploying release checks: `package-core` builds the
Release CLI and CPack ZIP/TGZ artifacts, `verify-core-install` stages a clean
install prefix, and `verify-core-package` checks the staged tree or both CPack
archives without opening a vehicle connection. They do not install to a system
prefix or change runtime infrastructure.

complexity-check applies the source-size rules to new and modified files: 500
lines per source file, 40 per Python function, and 120 columns per C/C++ line
(ruff already enforces the Python limit through E501). It also rejects a baseline
entry that no longer points at an oversized file, function or tolerated over-long
line, so the baselines cannot silently widen the gate.
`config/file_size_baseline.txt` lists only the oversized files that still exist;
`config/function_size_baseline.txt` is empty; `config/line_length_baseline.txt`
names the five legacy transport files whose existing over-length lines Phase E
deletes instead of wrapping. Add an entry only for a genuine offender — the
freshness check makes removing it when the file is split, the lines are wrapped,
or the file is deleted non-optional. The C/C++ column limit is enforced through
this reporter rather than clang-format because the formatter is not a pinned
repository dependency. Shared helper code lives in exactly one place: C++ tests use
`tests/test_harness.hpp` (assert/report/pass/fail plus the console-safe `main`)
and `tests/loopback_socket.hpp`; `nomad::util` owns argv and environment number
parsing; `infra/tailscale/shell.py` owns the command probe both monitors call. Do
not copy one of those helpers back into a caller.

`pixi run dev` and `dev-build` now build the C++ core. `pixi run test` measures
coverage of retained Python tools and Tailscale helpers. The deleted API server,
API smoke task and gimbal SITL task are removed.

`dev-up` starts isolated ArduPilot SITL plus the passive Mission Planner bridge;
it requires Docker and the `nomad-sitl:copter-4.7.1` image (build instructions are
in docker/docker-compose.dev.yml). `sitl` builds the core first, then starts that
stack and runs its scenario. `sim-ros-up` additionally forwards MAVLink to the
ROS adapter. Direct Compose ROS use must set `NOMAD_SITL_ROS_OUTPUT` to
`--out udp:nomad_vehicle_node:14552`. The simulator always emits the normal host
stream on 14570 and a private relay copy on 14572; scenario tasks choose which
stream to read through `NOMAD_CORE_SITL_PORT`.

The stack seeds the vehicle from two parameter files: `docker/sitl-fence.parm`
for the polygon fence and `docker/sitl-streams.parm` for the SERIAL0 MAVLink
stream rates. ArduPilot streams position, attitude and extended status only
after a GCS requests the group and the core deliberately never requests
streams, so those rates are what make a host-side copy readable; a stack that
drops them leaves the scenarios watching heartbeats. See C24 in
[migration](migration.md).
These paths have local configuration checks, but current live image/SITL/ROS
qualification remains open at G1.

`sim-ros-perception-up` and the three `sim-gazebo-up*` tasks fail with an explicit
unavailable message: no current sensor/launch provider is configured. Optional
image builds, GPU adapters and the Python video bridge remain available for
integration work. Raw Gazebo Compose services are scaffolding, not a working
simulator or perception demonstration.

On a configured companion host, `nomad start video_bridge` directly manages the
retained bridge inside the adapter container; it no longer calls a vehicle REST
service. The control endpoint is loopback-only. Product profiles keep this and
other optional compute services disabled until G3 qualification.

## Test layers

| Layer | Current checks | Required expansion |
|---|---|---|
| C++ | Ten CTest targets including runtime IPC fake-connection coverage | Authority, per-field freshness, cancellation, MAVSDK and vehicle-class coverage |
| Python | pytest includes client contracts, traceability, harnesses, profiles and video tools | Mock competition server/traffic, perception replay and tracker fixtures |
| ROS | ros2/nomad_ros translation plus tests/ros integration | Bounded callbacks, acquisition-time/frame validation, command-owner integration |
| Mission Planner | lint-plugin and test-plugin-* helper scripts | Ownership, capabilities, stale displays, action lifecycle and replay |
| SITL | core-sitl-* and sitl-fence | Current artifacts, QuadPlane transitions, competition scenarios and independent faults |
| Hardware | No evidence collected in this review | Selected board/sensor/radio/payload/endurance and task gates |

Tests/ros and live SITL checks are environment-gated; report skips explicitly.
The checked cpp_traceability block only proves references exist. It does not
prove every safety requirement is covered or satisfied.
The CONOPS traceability test checks inventory fields, source-page bounds, unique
IDs, canonical references, unresolved-question links and the single active ledger
item. Run `pixi run python -m pytest tests/test_conops_traceability.py -q` after
requirements edits. A passing structural check does not prove extraction
completeness, interpretation accuracy or implemented flight compliance.

`pixi run test-runtime-ipc` builds the core and exercises `nomad-runtime` with a
local fake MAVLink peer, including typed requests, client reconnect and runtime
restart. It does not require aircraft hardware or Docker.

## SITL discipline

Use an isolated identified simulator with known state. Serialize scenarios that
share vehicle state. Every important test establishes state, performs one action,
observes authoritative outcome, asserts independent conditions and restores
state when required. A relay ACK is not physical sample collection, and LAND
mode is not a completed landing.

Existing tasks: core-sitl-status, core-sitl-command-flow, core-sitl-mission,
core-sitl-velocity-watchdog, core-sitl-geofence, core-sitl-payload,
core-sitl-link-loss, core-sitl-link-recovery, core-sitl-zero-delivery,
core-sitl-gcs-heartbeat, core-sitl-quadplane-observe,
core-sitl-quadplane-vtol-takeoff, core-sitl-quadplane-transition,
core-sitl-quadplane-route and sitl-fence. Use them
against a configured isolated endpoint with no hardware path attached; a live
passing run is still required before G1 closes.

The Task 1 observation reference is ArduPlane 4.7.1 at exact commit
`dbe792162d06cab66c3475fd5556bf7a120f119e`, using the
`quadplane-tilttri` frame and `docker/quadplane-tilttri.parm`. Build and start it
with `pixi run quadplane-sitl-up`, observe it with
`pixi run core-sitl-quadplane-observe`, and stop it with
`pixi run quadplane-sitl-down`. The observer requires the real heartbeat,
`Q_ENABLE=2`, fresh position/GPS/attitude, disarmed state, and aircraft-reported
GUIDED=15, QLOITER=19, QRTL=21 and RTL=11 modes. ArduPlane reports this profile
as `MAV_TYPE_FIXED_WING` (1), not a VTOL MAV type. NOMAD combines that heartbeat
with `Q_ENABLE=1` or `2` to identify `QuadPlane`; zero identifies Plane, while a
failed read or another value leaves the class unresolved as `Unknown`.

This harness qualifies discovery, telemetry and baseline mode semantics, then
qualifies one explicit NOMAD startup path: QuadPlane GUIDED, authoritative arm,
and ArduPlane's direct GUIDED `MAV_CMD_NAV_TAKEOFF` climb by the requested
delta from the final pre-command relative altitude. NOMAD revalidates heartbeat,
fresh position, 3D GPS, armed state and GUIDED mode immediately before sending
the command, then requires the derived target within a fixed 0.5 m margin. The
Python mode driver requests the observed modes independently; it does not use
or qualify the production `Vehicle::set_mode` path for QuadPlane.
The separate transition harness qualifies only the dedicated
`Vehicle::transition_to_fixed_wing` operation after this startup sequence. The
route harness then uses the independent test operator to establish AUTO for the
qualified transition, and asks NOMAD to fly two fixed-wing GUIDED reposition
targets. The operator's AUTO request remains qualification setup; arbitrary
QuadPlane `Vehicle::set_mode` is rejected. NOMAD verifies each target from a
fresh post-ACK position sample at least 10 m closer than the captured
ACK-boundary position and within 45 m horizontally and 5 m vertically; route
success requires the second target. The harness independently observes the
ordered aircraft position trace. The recovery harness then repeats that
sequence and asks NOMAD to reposition to an explicit point near its starting
route location. Independent post-command position, altitude, mode and VTOL
telemetry must show the bounded recovery region reached while fixed wing.
The transition-back harness repeats the pinned identity/takeoff/forward
transition/route/recovery sequence. It then gives AUTO one explicit
`NAV_LOITER_UNLIM` mission item at the explicit recovery coordinates through the
independent test authority because the pinned transition handler requires AUTO.
It captures the first fresh recovered relative altitude as the transition target
altitude, and rejects setup unless it is within the reviewed 15–25 m band. This
avoids asking AUTO to climb or descend to the original requested recovery
altitude. The reference profile enters AUTO in VTOL state; the already-qualified
`transition-to-fixed-wing` operation reestablishes fixed-wing state before the
transition-ready dwell starts. NOMAD verifies the pinned frame and tilt
parameters before it separately requires the aircraft within 40 m of that
horizontal point, within 2 m of that captured altitude while remaining within
15–25 m relative to home, groundspeed no greater than 20 m/s, climb rate no
greater than 1 m/s, and five fresh position samples spanning 2 s with bounded
altitude/radial variation.
Completion requires fresh post-ACK `Multicopter` state reports, retained armed
AUTO mode and two seconds of stable position/velocity telemetry. Run `pixi run
core-sitl-quadplane-transition-back` for the pinned live sequence. These slices
do not qualify disarm, generic takeoff/goto, route planning, arbitrary RTL/QRTL,
VTOL landing, QuadPlane link-loss response or the complete Task 1 flight. Copter
mode numbers and velocity-stop behavior cannot stand in for those tests. Gazebo/Isaac are
optional sensor-evidence tools; they are not prerequisites for basic unit or
server-contract tests. The independent pymavlink mode driver establishes
`AUTO` because NOMAD deliberately rejects arbitrary QuadPlane `set_mode`; this
does not qualify an autonomous GUIDED -> AUTO -> transition sequence or transfer
command authority to the test driver.

## Adapter and optional build checks

The `build-core-mavsdk` and `mavsdk-phase-a-smoke` task names are historical:
every build is the MAVSDK transport now, and the latter still requires live SITL.
Follow [MAVSDK parity gates](mavsdk-adoption.md). The build task emits
configure/build timing and footprint JSON to standard output.

MAVSDK is the only transport, so the CLI has no way to select one: `--transport`
and `NOMAD_TRANSPORT` were removed with the Phase E cutover. `--transport` is now
an unknown-argument usage failure, and the environment variable is inert because
nothing can select a transport any more. Run `pixi run test-mavsdk-phase-b` for
the
transport contract check: it builds the CLI, `nomad_mavsdk_connection_tests` and
`nomad_mavsdk_zero_delivery_tests`, then runs
`scripts/dev/mavsdk_connection_fixture.py`, which asserts accepted, denied,
timeout, wire-form, stale-telemetry and wrong-identity behaviour plus
per-command mode/takeoff/goto/land/RTL/servo/relay/gimbal-config/user-command
parity against the deterministic vehicle in `scripts/dev/mavsdk_peer.py`; those
command cases run the real CLI and assert its verified output against a peer
whose starting state differs from the required result. The same task covers the
link and zero-delivery cases in `scripts/dev/mavsdk_link_fixture.py`: the
pre-latch GCS-heartbeat announcement, coalesced datagrams, live-to-stale link
observation, the body-frame velocity setpoint with its zero on disconnect, and
the SR-LNK-03 stop paths (watchdog, caller stop, destruction, link loss, VIO
loss). `scripts/dev/mavsdk_fixture_harness.py` holds the shared binary, peer and
assertion primitives; add a case to the module that owns its behaviour rather
than to the entry point. Passing it is transport
parity evidence, not a closed Phase B-E or G-M gate. The hosted matrix also writes and
retains a JSON artifact; local output from a dirty vendor checkout is diagnostic,
not clean-checkout qualification. Live smoke output includes per-process-tree
peak RSS and elapsed connect/status time and is retained by the SITL workflow.

ROS builds use the separate ament package and supported image; test-ros-integration
runs its real adapter tests. Current source still has blocking callbacks; passing
existing tests does not prove the target callback deadline contract.

Mission Planner uses Windows/.NET Framework 4.8 and its reference assemblies.
Use lint-plugin and relevant test-plugin-* tasks for non-deploying checks.
build-plugin invokes a script that can install/overwrite the local plugin;
inspect it and obtain deployment authorization before running it. Do not confuse
a pure helper test with full plugin integration.

## Contribution and evidence workflow

1. Read AGENTS and deeper guidance; trace owning symbols, callers and tests.
2. Define a concrete falsification test and keep one active work item.
3. Make one focused change; preserve unrelated staged/unstaged work.
4. Run focused tests, then full relevant checks; report every skip/failure.
5. Review the final diff and record requirement, artifact/config identity,
   independent observations, measured values, thresholds and limitations.
6. Update the canonical subject owner; avoid copying status into several plans.

Use a focused branch for implementation and the repository commit prefix style.
Do not stage, commit, push or deploy without an explicit request. MAVSDK
implementation needs a focused merge request with unit and integration evidence;
this documentation review only plans that work.

Size/complexity rules and technical-debt format remain in AGENTS. Keep C++ public
headers in include/nomad, implementation in src, and ROS/Python/vendor types out
of the core API. Retained Python is for tools, perception and tests, never a
parallel vehicle state machine.
