"""Prove the GCS heartbeat opens a heartbeat-gated UDP relay leg against SITL.

Real mavlink-router and MAVProxy setups only start streaming a UDP leg after
the endpoint announces itself with a GCS heartbeat. The C++ core therefore
emits a 1 Hz standard GCS heartbeat while it waits for the vehicle
(``encode_gcs_heartbeat`` in ``src/mavlink/protocol.cpp``, pinned byte-for-byte
by ``nomad_codec_golden_tests`` and by ``nomad_udp_tests`` in
``tests/udp_connection_test.cpp``).

The scenario places a heartbeat-gated UDP relay between the always-on SITL
stream (host UDP 14572, see docker-compose.dev.yml) and a fresh client port,
then runs the C++ CLI ``status`` verb through it twice:

1. Gate open: the relay starts forwarding the vehicle stream only after it
   sees a datagram from the client (mavlink-router behavior). The status read
   succeeds, the relayed datagrams are counted, and every captured client
   announcement is verified to be a standard GCS heartbeat (sysid 255,
   compid 190, MAV_TYPE_GCS) at ~1 Hz.
2. Gate closed (negative control): a relay copy that drops client
   announcements never forwards anything, so the status read must fail closed
   with the heartbeat-timeout diagnostic. The captured announcements prove the
   CLI actually announced — so the failure is the closed gate, not a missing
   announcement.

The status read is the authoritative check (telemetry through the whole relay
path), not a command acknowledgement.

The CLI announces to the relay through NOMAD_RELAY_ADDRESS (see
docs/operations.md): the configured endpoint is a wildcard listen address, so
the pre-latch announcement needs the relay's routable upstream port. The relay
binds the SITL stream port as its upstream — the same convention
core-sitl-link-recovery uses.

Run against the dev stack (see tests/sitl/README.md):
