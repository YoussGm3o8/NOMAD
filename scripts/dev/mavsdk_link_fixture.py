"""Link-level parity cases for the MAVSDK transport.

These are the legacy UDP transport's link proofs moved onto the MAVSDK
transport: the pre-latch GCS-heartbeat announcement that opens a heartbeat-gated
relay, MAVProxy-style coalesced datagrams, a heartbeat that dies while the
delivery path stays open, the body-frame velocity setpoint with its
zero-on-disconnect, the core-level zero-delivery scenarios of SR-LNK-03, and
the core fence upload and verification of SR-FEN-01.

Every case judges the peer's decoding of what arrived rather than the transport's
own report. `mavsdk_connection_fixture.py` is the entry point that runs these
with the command-parity cases; the pytest driver in
`tests/test_mavsdk_connection.py` runs them one by one.
