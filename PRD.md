## 1. Executive Summary

**NOMAD** is a distributed Command and Control (C2) architecture designed to bridge the "Air Gap" between the pilot and the intelligent edge. It utilizes a hybrid network strategy: a high-bandwidth 4G/LTE link for real-time video/API control (Task 2), and a low-latency ELRS dual-band link (2.4GHz + 900MHz Gemini) for safety-critical telemetry and control.

The system is designed for **two distinct task configurations**:

1.  **Task 1 (Outdoor Recon):** Traditional RC pilot control via ELRS directly to ArduPilot. Jetson is mounted for video streaming and imaging only. GPS/RTK positioning. No autonomous navigation.

2.  **Task 2 (Indoor Extinguish):** Jetson-centric autonomous navigation using Isaac ROS Nav2/Nvblox. ArduPilot operates in GUIDED mode as flight controller only. VIO positioning indoors. YOLO target detection. WASD controls available for human intervention over LTE if needed.

**Key Architecture Principle:** Task 1 uses traditional RC control. Task 2 uses Jetson for navigation with ArduPilot as a low-level flight controller.

---

## 2. System Architecture Scope

The system follows **Clean Architecture** principles, divided into three logical domains:

1.  **Domain A: Transport Layer (Connectivity)** - MAVLink routing, ELRS telemetry, and 4G/LTE communication.
2.  **Domain B: Edge Core** - The Onboard Orchestrator, VIO pipeline, and NavController running on Jetson Orin Nano. **Full autonomy stack deployed for Task 2 only. Task 1 uses Jetson for video/imaging only.**
3.  **Domain C: Mission Planner Integration** - A custom plugin providing telemetry display, WASD backup control (Task 2), and task interfaces.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Domain A: Transport Layer (Connectivity)

*Objective: Route MAVLink messages between Flight Controller and Ground Station.*

#### **A.1 Both Tasks: MAVLink + Tailscale**
*   **[NET-01] MAVLink Routing:**
    *   `mavlink-router` on Jetson routes telemetry between FC, Edge Core, and Ground Station.
    *   **Input:** USB/UART from Cube Orange.
    *   **Output 1:** UDP `127.0.0.1:14550` - Edge Core NavController
    *   **Output 2:** UDP `127.0.0.1:14551` - Vision Process
    *   **Output 3:** UDP `<Ground_IP>:14550` - Mission Planner (via Tailscale)

*   **[NET-02] Tailscale VPN:**
    *   4G/LTE USB modem provides Internet connectivity.
    *   Tailscale mesh VPN enables secure communication to Ground Station.
    *   Exposes: HTTP API (8000), MAVLink (14550), RTSP (8554), SSH (22).

*   **[NET-03] ELRS Fallback:**
    *   ELRS remains active as backup control link.
    *   If 4G/Tailscale fails, pilot can take manual RC control.

#### **A.2 Task 1 Specific: GPS/RTK**
*   **[T1-NET-01] RTCM Corrections:**
    *   RTK corrections delivered via Mission Planner MAVLink injection (`GPS_INJECT_DATA`).
    *   Operator must verify RTK Fixed (`fix_type=6`) before flight.

### 3.2 Domain B: Edge Core

*Objective: Jetson Orin Nano running Python 3.13.9 for video streaming (Task 1) and autonomous operations (Task 2).*

**NOTE:**
- **Task 1:** Jetson provides video streaming and imaging. Flight controlled by pilot via ELRS RC.
- **Task 2:** Jetson handles autonomous navigation via Nav2/Nvblox. ArduPilot operates in GUIDED mode. WASD controls available for LTE-based human intervention if needed.

#### **B.1 Orchestrator & State Management**
*   **[EDGE-ORCH-01] API Interface:** FastAPI service exposing endpoints for status, health, and Task 2 control.
*   **[EDGE-ORCH-02] Watchdog:** Monitor Vision/VIO process health. Auto-restart on hang without severing MAVLink connection.
*   **[EDGE-TIME-01] Time Sync:** NTP client (Chrony) for system time via 4G. Fallback to GPS time from MAVLink if 4G unavailable.

#### **B.2 VIO Integration (Task 2)**
*   **[T2-NAV-01] ZED Visual-Inertial Odometry:**
    *   Dedicated process interfacing with ZED SDK.
    *   Transform ZED pose to NED frame.
    *   Stream `VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE` to Flight Controller at **30Hz**.
    *   Process pinned to high-priority CPU cores.

*   **[T2-NAV-02] EKF Source Configuration:**
    *   Indoor Source Set (SRC2): ExternalNav for position, velocity, and yaw.
    *   Magnetometer disabled indoors (`EK3_SRC2_YAW=6`).
    *   VIO health monitored via EKF_STATUS_REPORT variances/innovations.

*   **[T2-NAV-03] Jetson-Centric Navigation:**
    *   **ArduPilot operates as flight controller only** - no internal path planning.
    *   Isaac ROS Nav2/Nvblox generates velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`).
    *   Edge Core NavController forwards commands to ArduPilot GUIDED mode.
    *   Full obstacle avoidance via Nvblox 3D costmap.
    *   See `docs/JETSON_NAV_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed architecture.

#### **B.3 Target Detection & Engagement (Task 2)**
*   **[T2-CV-01] YOLO Detection:**
    *   YOLOv8 model detecting Purple (dry) and Blue/Green (wet) pH targets.
    *   Inference on Jetson GPU.

*   **[T2-FIRE-01] Firing Solution:**
    *   Trigger water pump only when:
        1. Target class is "Purple" (dry)
        2. Target NOT in Exclusion Map
        3. Aiming error < 5 degrees
        4. Range 1.5m - 2.5m

*   **[T2-MEM-01] Exclusion Map:**
    *   Log sprayed target 3D coordinates in VIO frame.
    *   Ignore future detections within 0.5m of stored coordinates.

*   **[T2-AIM-01] Gimbal Visual Servoing:**
    *   PID loop on camera feed to center target.
    *   Send `MOUNT_CONTROL` MAVLink messages for gimbal control.

#### **B.4 Safety & Failsafes (Task 2)**
*   **[T2-SAFE-01] VIO Failure Response:**
    *   If VIO unhealthy for >3 seconds (innovation/variance thresholds exceeded):
        1. Switch EKF source to fallback (Baro/IMU only)
        2. Set flight mode to `ALT_HOLD`
        3. Alert pilot for manual takeover
    *   **NOT:** Auto-land (may hit obstacles), RTL (no GPS indoors), motor kill (unsafe)

*   **[T2-SAFE-02] Thermal Protection:**
    *   If Jetson temp > 85°C: Throttle YOLO inference, never throttle VIO.

*   **[T2-SAFE-03] Brownout Protection:**
    *   If battery < critical threshold: Disable Vision Engine (GPU) to preserve flight power.
